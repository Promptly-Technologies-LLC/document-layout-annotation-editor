Of course. Based on the code you've provided and the symptoms you're describing, I see the issue.

The console log confirms that your data is being loaded and the `renderAnnotations` function is being called correctly. However, the annotation elements are being created in memory but are never actually added to the web page.

### The Problem

In `src/client/components/PdfViewer.ts`, your `renderAnnotations` method iterates through the annotations and calls `createAnnotationElement` for each one. The `createAnnotationElement` function correctly builds and returns an `HTMLElement`, but the return value is discarded. You need to take that returned element and append it to the `overlay` div.

Here is the problematic section in `src/client/components/PdfViewer.ts`:

```typescript
// src/client/components/PdfViewer.ts

// ... inside the PdfViewer class ...

private renderAnnotations(): void {
  // ... (clearing annotations and getting pageAnnotations is fine)
  
  console.log('Rendering annotations for page', this.currentPage, pageAnnotations);
  
  // ------------------- ISSUE IS HERE -------------------
  pageAnnotations.forEach(annotation => {
    this.createAnnotationElement(annotation); // This creates an element, but it's not used.
  });
  // -----------------------------------------------------
}
```

### The Solution

You need to append the element returned by `createAnnotationElement` to `this.overlay`.

**Modify the `renderAnnotations` method in `src/client/components/PdfViewer.ts` as follows:**

```typescript
// src/client/components/PdfViewer.ts

private renderAnnotations(): void {
  // Clear existing annotations
  this.overlay.querySelectorAll('.annotation-box').forEach(el => el.remove());
  
  const annotations = annotationStore.getStore().annotations;
  const pageAnnotations = annotations.filter(a => a.page_number === this.currentPage);
  
  console.log('Rendering annotations for page', this.currentPage, pageAnnotations);
  
  pageAnnotations.forEach(annotation => {
    // Create the element
    const annotationElement = this.createAnnotationElement(annotation);
    // Append it to the overlay so it becomes visible
    this.overlay.appendChild(annotationElement);
  });
}
```

### Deeper Dive & Potential Secondary Issue

While the above fix is almost certainly the primary problem, there's another potential issue in your scaling logic.

In `createAnnotationElement`, you have this code:

```typescript
// src/client/components/PdfViewer.ts

const scaleX = this.canvas.width / annotation.page_width;
const scaleY = this.canvas.height / annotation.page_height;
```

Your `schema.json` and `Annotation` type correctly define `page_width` and `page_height`. However, looking at your console log, the objects in the array are truncated:

```console
{left: 5, top: 184, width: 13, height: 144, page_number: 1, â€¦}
```

If the JSON files you are loading *do not* contain `page_width` and `page_height` for each annotation, `annotation.page_width` would be `undefined`. The calculation `this.canvas.width / undefined` results in `NaN` (Not a Number). Setting CSS properties like `left` or `width` to `NaNpx` will cause the element to not render correctly.

**To fix this, you should ensure two things:**

1.  **Data Integrity:** Your JSON files in the `/output` directory must contain valid `page_width` and `page_height` properties for every annotation object.
2.  **Defensive Code (Recommended):** Add a fallback in case the data is missing, so the application doesn't completely fail to render the box.

You could modify `createAnnotationElement` to be more robust:

```typescript
// src/client/components/PdfViewer.ts

private createAnnotationElement(annotation: Annotation): HTMLElement {
    const box = document.createElement('div');
    // ...

    // Use the canvas dimensions as a fallback if page dimensions are missing from the annotation data
    const page_width = annotation.page_width || this.canvas.width;
    const page_height = annotation.page_height || this.canvas.height;
    
    const scaleX = this.canvas.width / page_width;
    const scaleY = this.canvas.height / page_height;
    
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

This change ensures that even if `page_width` and `page_height` are missing from a specific annotation, it assumes the annotation was made on a page of the same dimensions as the currently rendered canvas, which is a reasonable fallback.

In summary, the main fix is to `appendChild`, but you should also verify your data and consider making the scaling logic more robust.
